# Crane Braking Transistor and Resistor Calculator
This tool helps select the Yaskawa CR700 drive, external braking transistor, and braking resistor for a given hoist application.


## Backlog
- Finish CR700 selection
  - Verify that CR700 is still OK when considering resistor tolerances
  - In case selected CR700 is too small, check if larger one is available that can fulfil application requirements
- Program in infinte loop
- Divide selection in 1) Internal Braking Transistor and 2) External Braking Transistor
- Start to program unit tests
